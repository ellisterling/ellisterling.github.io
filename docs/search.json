    "text": "Abstract\nIn this blog post, we will analyze the Palmer Penguins dataset, which was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station in Antarctica. It contains various types of quantitative and qualitative data about the penguins observed by Gorman et al. To analyze this data, we will train a machine learning model on it, and find the best combination of features to train that model on. We will then test our model against the test dataset and determine its usability. The model we will use is a Logistic Regression model, which uses linear equations to create boundaries and categorizes based on those boundaries.\n\n\nSetup\nFirst we can load in the data as a Pandas dataframe.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ntrain_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/ml-notes/main/data/palmer-penguins/train.csv\"\ntrain = pd.read_csv(train_url)\n\nWe can then look at the dataframe we have made:\n\ntrain.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudyName\nSample Number\nSpecies\nRegion\nIsland\nStage\nIndividual ID\nClutch Completion\nDate Egg\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nSex\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nComments\n\n\n\n\n0\nPAL0809\n31\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN63A1\nYes\n11/24/08\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\nFEMALE\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nNaN\n\n\n1\nPAL0809\n41\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN74A1\nYes\n11/24/08\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\nMALE\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nNaN\n\n\n2\nPAL0708\n4\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\nAnvers\nBiscoe\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN32A2\nYes\n11/27/07\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\nMALE\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nNaN\n\n\n3\nPAL0708\n15\nGentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)\nAnvers\nBiscoe\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN38A1\nYes\n12/3/07\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\nFEMALE\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nNaN\n\n\n4\nPAL0809\n34\nChinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN65A2\nYes\n11/24/08\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\nMALE\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can shorten the species of the penguins to just the first word, which will make it easier to catalogue them.\n\ntrain[\"Species\"] = train[\"Species\"].str.split().str.get(0)\ntrain.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudyName\nSample Number\nSpecies\nRegion\nIsland\nStage\nIndividual ID\nClutch Completion\nDate Egg\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nSex\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nComments\n\n\n\n\n0\nPAL0809\n31\nChinstrap\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN63A1\nYes\n11/24/08\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\nFEMALE\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nNaN\n\n\n1\nPAL0809\n41\nChinstrap\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN74A1\nYes\n11/24/08\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\nMALE\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nNaN\n\n\n2\nPAL0708\n4\nGentoo\nAnvers\nBiscoe\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN32A2\nYes\n11/27/07\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\nMALE\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nNaN\n\n\n3\nPAL0708\n15\nGentoo\nAnvers\nBiscoe\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN38A1\nYes\n12/3/07\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\nFEMALE\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nNaN\n\n\n4\nPAL0809\n34\nChinstrap\nAnvers\nDream\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN65A2\nYes\n11/24/08\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\nMALE\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Creation\nNow that we’ve preprocessed the data a little bit, we can create a few plots to get an idea of what this data means. Below, we use seaborn to create a scatterplot and a bar plot.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize = (3.5, 8))\n\np1 = sns.scatterplot(train, x = \"Flipper Length (mm)\", y = 'Delta 13 C (o/oo)', hue = \"Species\", style = \"Species\", ax = ax[0], legend=False)\np2 = sns.barplot(train, x = \"Island\", y = \"Body Mass (g)\", hue = 'Species')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A scatterplot showing flipper length against Delta 13 C for three species of penguins. We can see that there is some correlation, but at the edges the species overlap a bit.\nFigure 2: A bar graph showing body mass for each species on each island. Torgerson only contains Adelie, Dream has pretty equal body masses for Adelie and Chinstrap, and Biscoe has Gentoo penguins at a much larger size than the other penguins.\nFrom these figures, we can tell that flipper length differentiates Adelie and Gentoo penguins, and that Delta 13 C differentiates Adelie and Chinstrap penguins\nNow that we’ve seen some of the data plotted out, we can continue the preprocessing step. The predict() function below drops unnecessary columns, rows/columns with null values, assigns species to integers rather than strings, and then splits the species into a separate data structure, y.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle.fit(train[\"Species\"])\n\ndef prepare_data(df):\n  df = df.drop([\"studyName\", \"Sample Number\", \"Individual ID\", \"Date Egg\", \"Comments\", \"Region\"], axis = 1)\n  df = df[df[\"Sex\"] != \".\"]\n  df = df.dropna()\n  y = le.transform(df[\"Species\"])\n  df = df.drop([\"Species\"], axis = 1)\n  df = pd.get_dummies(df)\n  return df, y\n\nx_train, y_train = prepare_data(train)\nx_train\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nIsland_Biscoe\nIsland_Dream\nIsland_Torgersen\nStage_Adult, 1 Egg Stage\nClutch Completion_No\nClutch Completion_Yes\nSex_FEMALE\nSex_MALE\n\n\n\n\n0\n40.9\n16.6\n187.0\n3200.0\n9.08458\n-24.54903\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n1\n49.0\n19.5\n210.0\n3950.0\n9.53262\n-24.66867\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\n50.0\n15.2\n218.0\n5700.0\n8.25540\n-25.40075\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\n45.8\n14.6\n210.0\n4200.0\n7.79958\n-25.62618\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n4\n51.0\n18.8\n203.0\n4100.0\n9.23196\n-24.17282\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n270\n51.1\n16.5\n225.0\n5250.0\n8.20660\n-26.36863\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n271\n35.9\n16.6\n190.0\n3050.0\n8.47781\n-26.07821\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n272\n39.5\n17.8\n188.0\n3300.0\n9.66523\n-25.06020\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n273\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\n8.76651\n-25.32426\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n274\n42.4\n17.3\n181.0\n3600.0\n9.35138\n-24.68790\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n256 rows × 14 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding on attributes\nWe now need to pick the attributes that will yield the best prediction accuracy. To do this, we will use an exhaustive approach, where we check the accuracy of a linear regression model trained on all possible feature combinations. In the code below, we loop through all possible combinations of qualitative and quantitative attributes. In each iteration, we train a model on the different combinations of features, and we compile an array of all the combinations (along with their scores and the model that was trained on them).\n\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nall_qual_cols = [\"Clutch Completion\", \"Island\", \"Sex\", \"Stage\"]\nall_quant_cols = ['Culmen Length (mm)', 'Culmen Depth (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)', \"Body Mass (g)\", \"Delta 15 N (o/oo)\", \"Delta 13 C (o/oo)\"]\nscores = []\ncombo_array = []\n\n\nfor qual in all_qual_cols:\n  qual_cols = [col for col in x_train.columns if qual in col ]\n  for pair in combinations(all_quant_cols, 2):\n1    cols = list(pair) + qual_cols\n    combo_array.append(cols)\n2    LR = LogisticRegression()\n    LR.fit(x_train[cols], y_train)\n3    new_score = LR.score(x_train[cols], y_train)\n4    scores.append((cols, new_score, LR))\n\n\n1\n\nGather the features for this iteration\n\n2\n\nCreate the Logistic Regression model and train it on our selected features\n\n3\n\nScore the trained model\n\n4\n\nAdd the features, score, and model as a tuple to the array of our catalogued models\n\n\n\n\n/Users/ellisterling/anaconda3/envs/ml-0451/lib/python3.13/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py:465: ConvergenceWarning: lbfgs failed to converge (status=1):\nSTOP: TOTAL NO.
